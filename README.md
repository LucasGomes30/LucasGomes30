  <summary>👨‍💻 More about me</summary>

  - 💬 I am 25 years old, currently living in Brazil. I have fluency in English and have experience with SQL, Python, Data Analysis, Data visualization, and Machine Learning. I'm also a content creator on YouTube since 2018, which helped me develop important skills such as creativity, communication, marketing, analytical capability, community and social media management.

  - ⚡ I enjoy reading, whether it's a good book, manga, or comics, as well as watching movies and playing games! I believe that our personal interests contribute to a more refined perception of things and problem-solving. \o/
